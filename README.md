# C# Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](#car-insurance)

- ### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

- [NFL Stats](#nfl-stats)

### NFL Stats
This is a data visualization application meant to store and display football stats for fantasy football purposes. It utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and follows a Code First workflow.
